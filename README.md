Welcome to the Sprint Estimator 2.0 - the ultimate tool for figuring out how long it will take to complete 
your next sprint... or at least get really close!

Are you tired of constantly overestimating the amount of work that needs to be done in a sprint? 
Well, fear not because the Sprint Estimator 2.0 has got you covered.

With our revolutionary Fibonacci-based estimation system, you and your team can now accurately predict 
how long it will take to complete each task. Simply input your tickets, let the magic of the Fibonacci sequence 
do its thing, and voila! You'll have a pretty good idea of how long it will take to get everything done.

But that's not all! The Sprint Estimator 2.0 also comes with a real-time leaderboard, 
so you can see who on your team is the most optimistic (or realistic) estimator. And, drum roll please... 
the feature you've all been waiting for: CONFETTI! Yes, that's right, whenever someone accurately 
estimates a ticket, the Sprint Estimator 2.0 will shower them with virtual confetti. 
It's like a little party in your browser!

So why wait? Start estimating like a pro with the Sprint Estimator 2.0 today!
